Overview
========

``pipeworks_ipc`` provides deterministic hash functions used to construct
Interpretive Provenance Chain (IPC) identifiers across Pipe-Works projects.

Design goals
------------

- deterministic outputs with stable normalization
- no runtime heavy dependencies
- compatibility with existing Axis Descriptor Lab IPC semantics
